## Before you begin
To use virtual environment with jupyter notebooks you need to:
1. make sure you are in the project directory
2. create virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
3. activate environment `source env/bin/activate`
4. install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. install kernel `python -m ipykernel install --name py-sentimentanalysis`
6. launch jupyter notebook `jupyter-notebook`
7. after you are done - deactivate environment `deactivate`
